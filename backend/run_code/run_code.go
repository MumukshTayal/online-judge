// RUN the code which is not submitted for evaluation
// runtime checking of the code on the open testcases of a problem
// Two ways to implement:
// 		- Save in database and then send to judge server like normal submission of code
// 		- Don't save in database and send to judge server
// check for security and ease of implementation between the two
